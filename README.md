## üåü About the Project

**Gradient Generator** is a web application designed to simplify the process of creating and customizing CSS gradients. Whether you're a developer, designer, or simply looking for a unique visual touch for your website, this tool allows you to generate linear, radial (and potentially conic in future updates) gradients with a fluid user interface and instant preview. Forget about writing complex CSS code from scratch; with Gradient Generator, you can visualize and adjust your gradients in seconds.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Intuitive User Interface**: Clean and easy-to-use design, allowing for quick adaptation.
* **Gradient Type Support**: Create `linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient` types.
* **Color Stop Control**: Add, remove, and adjust the position of multiple color stops to create complex transitions.
* **Advanced Color Picker**: Integration of an interactive color picker with HEX and RGBA support, allowing precise color and transparency adjustments.
* **Gradient Bar Manipulation**: Drag and drop color stops directly on the gradient preview bar for precise visual control.
* **Real-time Preview**: See how your changes affect the gradient instantly.
* **Angle Adjustment**: Control the direction of linear gradients with an angle selector.
* **Copy CSS Functionality**: Copy the generated CSS gradient code with a single click, ready for use in your projects.
* **Input Validation**: Ensures that color positions and other values are within valid ranges.

## üöÄ Technologies Used

This project is built with a stack of modern and efficient web development technologies:

* **React**: A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces and reusable components.
* **Tailwind CSS**: A "utility-first" CSS framework for building custom designs directly in your HTML markup, facilitating rapid development and consistent styling.
* **`react-colorful`**: A small and fast color picker library for React, providing color and transparency selection functionality.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The primary programming language for frontend logic.
* **HTML5**: For the semantic structure of the content.
* **CSS3**: For general styles and presentation.

## üí° Usage

1.  **Select Gradient Type**: Choose between "Linear" or "Radial".
2.  **Adjust Angle**: For linear gradients, use the slider or the numeric field to define the angle.
3.  **Manage Color Stops**:
    * Click on the color circles in the preview bar to select them.
    * Use the **Color Picker** to change the color and transparency of the selected stop.

    * Click **"Add Stop"** to add a new color point.
    * Click the "X" to **remove** a stop (a minimum of 2 stops is required).
